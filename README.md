# Homelab & Game Server Documentation

Welcome to the public repository for my Homelab and Game Server configurations. This project is a live, synchronized collection of data used to power the Homelab and Guides section of [trentbauer.com](https://trentbauer.com).

## Educational Focus & Community Intent
This repository has been structured with an educational focus to support the self-hosting community. By providing a transparent look at a functional production environment, this resource aims to offer real-world examples of:

* **Infrastructure as Code:** Utilizing modular Docker Compose files for scalable service deployment.
* **Security Best Practices:** Implementing CrowdSec and Cloudflare to protect public-facing services from malicious traffic.
* **Game Server Management:** Providing deep-dive configuration tuning for panels like Pelican and Pterodactyl, along with specific game optimizations for titles such as *Insurgency: Sandstorm*.

## Community & Support
This project is an open-source educational resource. While primarily for documentation, minimal community support is available through:
* **Website**: Technical guides and deep dives at [trentbauer.com](https://trentbauer.com).

## Pterodactyl / Pelican
I have uploaded custom and modified eggs [here](https://github.com/trentnbauer/PelicanEggs)
